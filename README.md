# NEAT-BioInspiredProject
An implementation of Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm to train population of agents which accomplish a common goal.



Notes:

1. Keep parents after cross-over along with children or replace the children with the parents (keep only children, drop parents)
2. Mutate child after cross-over
3. Add a different selection operator (proportionate or ranked selection) along each species
4. Change the way fitness is calculated
5. Improve on the way speciation factor Î´ is calculated
